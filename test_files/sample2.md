# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Classification
   - Regression

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality reduction

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Agent-based learning
   - Reward optimization

## Common Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering

## Applications

Machine learning is used in various domains including:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
