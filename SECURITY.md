# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Active development                            |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                | No longer supported                           |
| dev     | :warning:          | Pre-release - use at your own risk           |

- **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will work with you on responsible disclosure

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report:

1. **Acknowledgment**: You'll receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
2. **Communication**: We'll keep you informed about our progress
3. **Questions**: We may ask for additional information or clarification
4. **Testing**: We may ask you to test patches or validate fixes
5. **Credit**: With your permission, we'll acknowledge your contribution in our security advisories

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment Security

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Never commit `.env` files or secrets to version control
   - Use strong, unique passwords for all services

2. **File Upload Security**
   - Regularly review allowed file types and adjust based on your needs
   - Implement virus scanning for uploaded files in production
   - Monitor storage quotas to prevent DoS attacks

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement authentication before deploying to production
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
   - Regularly audit access logs

4. **Network Security**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if possible

5. **Container Security**
   - Regularly update base images
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
   - Run containers with minimal privileges
   - Use read-only root filesystems where possible

### Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date (`pip install --upgrade`)
- [ ] Security headers are configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Input validation is enabled for all endpoints
- [ ] File upload restrictions are properly configured
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Logging doesn't include sensitive data
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Database connections use SSL/TLS
- [ ] Secrets are managed using a secure vault
- [ ] Regular backups are configured and tested

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

The File Management API currently includes the following security measures:

1. **Path Traversal Protection**: All file paths are sanitized
2. **File Type Validation**: MIME type and extension validation
3. **File Size Limits**: Configurable maximum file size
4. **Filename Sanitization**: Special characters and Unicode normalization

### Planned Security Enhancements

We are planning to implement:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: OAuth2/JWT support
2. **Encryption at Rest**: For stored files
3. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging
4. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection
5. **Content Security Policy**: Enhanced XSS protection

## Security Tools and Scanning

We recommend using the following tools to assess security:

### Static Analysis

```bash
# Python security linting
pip install bandit
bandit -r app/

# Dependency vulnerability scanning
pip install safety
safety check

# Container scanning
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $HOME/.cache:/root/.cache aquasec/trivy image your-image:tag
```

### Dynamic Analysis

```bash
# OWASP ZAP for web vulnerability scanning
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py \
  -t http://your-app-url

# SQLMap for SQL injection testing (if using database)
sqlmap -u "http://your-app-url/api/endpoint" --batch
```

### Dependency Management

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Audit dependencies
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit

# Generate dependency tree
pip install pipdeptree
pipdeptree
```

## Security Headers Configuration

Example security headers for production deployment:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware
from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

# Security headers middleware
@app.middleware("http")
async def add_security_headers(request, call_next):
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
    response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
    response.headers["X-XSS-Protection"] = "1; mode=block"
    response.headers["Strict-Transport-Security"] = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
    response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = "default-src 'self'"
    return response
```

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Isolate**: Immediately isolate affected systems
2. **Assess**: Determine the scope and impact
3. **Contain**: Stop the incident from spreading
4. **Eradicate**: Remove the threat
5. **Recover**: Restore normal operations
6. **Review**: Conduct post-incident analysis
